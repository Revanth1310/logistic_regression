✅ Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
Choose a binary classification dataset (target = 0 or 1).

Preprocess the features (including scaling/encoding if necessary).

Split into training and testing sets.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate the model using:

Confusion matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC curve

Tune the classification threshold (e.g., 0.5 → 0.6) based on goals.

Understand sigmoid function, which converts linear output to probability.
